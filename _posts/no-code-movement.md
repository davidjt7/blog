## A Natural Consequence
We've come a long way from the early days of electronics. We went through punch cards, binary, assembly, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and now have new-comers with promises of flexibility in ease of use with increased control in Go and more so, Rust.

It's been getting increasingly easier for people to get into coding with the rise of high-level programming languages as well as shared libraries and scaffolding frameworks, which let designers narrow their attention towards their main scope. The No Code movement is a trendy term for a movement that has been in place since the birth of human ingenuity and technology.

## That's Cool. So Can I Leave It All To Tech Eventually?
Not really. Life is obviously a lot easier than what it was ever before, but there's still a lot to be done. This glorious tech is built by our best minds, who are still human and prone to errors and there are a lot more errors to fix and improvements to be made than what all humans can currently handle. What you can do to contribute is share your domain expertise and help in patching bugs in our existing frameworks.

We are at a very nascent stage when it comes to AI and have to create plenty more useful datasets for artificial models to consume.
