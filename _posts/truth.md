*A proposition is considered to have objective truth when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a sentient subject. Scientific objectivity refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence.*

I like this description of truth because of how it recursively contradicts itself. Continuing in this line of thought, I'll assert that an objective truth is a sum of multifarious subjective ones.
